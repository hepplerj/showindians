<h2>Data and Source Material</h2>

<p>The digital project relies upon a collection of digital material that numbers upwards of 400 pages and {{COUNT}} words digitized and converted to plain text to be used for analysis. Much of the source material was collected by Jason A. Heppler on research trips and are now part of the William F. Cody Archive. The source material was processed by computational methods to use "distant reading" of the collection of material.</p>

<h2>Natural Langauge Processing</h2>

<p>The Progressive Wild West uses natural language processing techniques to examine the language used by the Wild West and its perceptions of American Indians. These techniques included:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Word Counts</strong>: As <a href="https://tedunderwood.com/2013/02/20/wordcounts-are-amazing/">Ted Underwood has argued</a>, word counts serve as a useful barometer for gauging the basics of a corpus of text. Counts among the material relating to the Wild West gives a quick sense of the language usage that can be further contextualize by close reading and the nitty-gritty of historical analysis.</li>
    <li><strong>Topic Modeling</strong>: Topic modeling is a computational method that compares word usage around every word in a corpus, and then determines collections of words that form a topic. Topic models were run on small corpus sets separated out by text genre to examine how language usage changed depending on the type of document was produced.</li>
</ul>
