## About

The project began as an electronic research archive of over one hundred
documents and hundreds of contracts relating to Native Americans in
Buffalo Bill's Wild West. The project has since evolved into a
different form, allowing for the browsing and querying of documentary
material and computational methods of analysis. My initial research
interest drew me to the Native performers themselves, which allowed me
to create -- to the best of my knowledge -- the first aggregated
collection of Native American performers who were verified to work for
the Wild West through primary sources such as signed contracts,
government records, programs, and pamphlets. These documents are
available now at the [William F. Cody Archive](https://codyarchive.org).

The project now seeks a different answer to a different question: why
was the employment of Native people in Wild West shows so heavily
contested? William F. Cody engaged in several highly publicized debates
with government officials who sought to restrict the hiring of Native
Americans during the course of the Wild West's existence. These debates
reflected a broad discussion about federal Indian policy and efforts by
the government to "civilize" Native peoples. Cody, for his part,
likewise believed in reform that would "save" Native peoples from what
he and others saw as their inevitable demise in modern society. But
Cody's form of progressivism reflected a different course of action:
rather than forced coercion, a demonstration of the benefits of modern
American society would usher in changes that would "save" Indians. The
contest over these two ideas of progressive reform are barely
distinguishable, but reveal competing ideas about federal policy, the
role of government, and moral reform.
