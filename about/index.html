<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  The project began as an electronic research archive of over one hundred
  documents and hundreds of contracts relating to Native Americans in Buffalo
  Bill's Wild West. The project has since evolved into a different form,
  allowing for the browsing and querying of documentary material and
  computational methods of analysis. My initial research interest drew me to the
  Native performers themselves, which allowed me to create -- to the best of my
  knowledge -- the first aggregated collection of Native American performers who
  were verified to work for the Wild West through primary sources such as signed
  contracts, government records, programs, and pamphlets. These documents are
  available now at the
  <a href="https://codyarchive.org">William F. Cody Archive</a>.

  The project now seeks a different answer to a different question: why was the
  employment of Native people in Wild West shows so heavily contested? William
  F. Cody engaged in several highly publicized debates with government officials
  who sought to restrict the hiring of Native Americans during the course of the
  Wild West's existence. These debates reflected a broad discussion about
  federal Indian policy and efforts by the government to "civilize" Native
  peoples. Cody, for his part, likewise believed in reform that would "save"
  Native peoples from what he and others saw as their inevitable demise in
  modern society. But Cody's form of progressivism reflected a different course
  of action: rather than forced coercion, a demonstration of the benefits of
  modern American society would usher in changes that would "save" Indians. The
  contest over these two ideas of progressive reform are barely distinguishable,
  but reveal competing ideas about federal policy, the role of government, and
  moral reform.
