<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>In 1899 the Department of the Interior issued a new policy regarding the employment of Indians for exhibitions and circuses. Commissioner of Indian Affairs William A. Jones explained in December 1899 that "there will be no more Indians permitted to leave their reservations for Wild West Exhibition purposes." The reason for the policy was because touring with such exhibitions was considered detrimental to the process of "civilizing" Indians. No exhibitions would be allowed to hire Indians "unless they are planned on lines showing the progress in Indian education. . . . Such shows demoralize the Indians, many of whom would dress in citizen's clothes and would otherwise conform to more civilized ways but for the money there is in continuing in their old customs."<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The policy did not sit well with William F. Cody, proprietor of Buffalo Bill's Wild West. The government's policy against the hiring of Show Indians was not just bad for business, but hurt Indians themselves according to Cody.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Writing to his good friend Mike Russell, Cody noted that "there has been another crank appointed Commissioner and he says I can't have any Indians for my show." The commissioner, he continued, "wants to keep Indians prisoners on their reservations" and "not allow them to earn an honest dollar." Cody feared that not giving Indians "liberty" would only cause troubles on the frontier and ignite new wars.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> That Cody referred to Indian wages and reservations as prisons in personal correspondence reveals a divergent thread of progressive thought from other reformist-minded thinkers of the Gilded Age. For Cody the Wild West was more than a vehicle for entertainment: it was a civilizing tool that exposed Indians to the superiority of Euro-American society and culture.</p>

<p>While known for opening up Indian land for white settlement and railroad expansion, the Dawes General Allotment Act also had a progressive intention: to introduce Indians to sedentary farming and stock–raising through the purchase of individual land allotments. The promotion of private property, individualism, Christianity, and economic independence was the assimilationist ideal for involuntarily imposing American values upon tribal communities. As a piece of Reformist Progressive legislation, the Dawes Act forced Native people into a position of adopting progressive values with no consideration for traditional Native culture. Supporters of the Dawes Act saw no reason to allow Native peoples to be given the choice of adopting new lifestyles, because any choice would likely mean Indians chose to continue their traditional ways rather than adopt progressive ideals. </p>

<p>Government policies and laws only served to bolster the progressive platform of reform. Native Americans had become a problem for Progressive reformers, not only because of their attitudes and beliefs but because they were on land desired by Plains settlers. The confluence of two desires in American politics – access to land occupied by Indian tribes and a desire to absorb Indians into mainstream society – resulted in federal assimilation policies in the 1870s and 1880s. The results of such work, in the logic of progressives, would be individualistic, hard-working citizens. </p>

<p>Transferring tribal land into 160 acre parcels to Indians and non-Indians was not the only strategy employed by Progressives. In 1870 Congress allocated $100,000 as the first annual appropriation for Indian education directed towards day schools and boarding schools. By 1873 boarding schools were the preferred format of Indian assimilation to instruct Native children in academic, domestic, vocational, and agricultural education.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> In 1879 under the leadership of Richard Henry Pratt, the government established the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania where children were removed from their families, homes, and communities and sent to learn skills in a curriculum that included subjects in English, mathematics, history, drawing, and composition.</p>

<p>Religious education also served a central component to reform. Religious reformists sent Christian missionaries to Indian reservations to educate Native peoples about what they considered to be heathen practices and point them in the path of righteousness. Convinced that they were taking on the burden of assimilating Indians as Christian farmers and businessmen, Quakers, Catholics, Episcopalians, and other "friends of the Indian" began educating Indian children in religious and vocational instruction. </p>

<p>But by 1900 the policy of assimilation disappointed Progressives. The land-hungry among them wished for quicker access to Indian land while those more sympathetic wrung their hands over the lack of American ideals adopted by tribal communities. Among three-thousand Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians located in western Oklahoma, only twenty percent were raising their own crops by 1900. Land allotments at Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho, noted progressive journalist Ray Stannard Baker, left Indians "exactly as before, looking on imperturbably, eating, sleeping, idling, with no more thought of the future than a white man's child."<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The year 1900 marked a shift in assimilationist thinking. If Indians could not become fully American, progressives reasoned the best alternative of their survival would be to keep them completely separate from the rest of society. To this end, President Theodore Roosevelt pursued a new federal Indian policy that followed Progressive ideals. In his annual message to Congress in 1902, Roosevelt explained that "our aim should be their [the Indians] ultimate absorption into the body of our people. But in many cases this absorption must and should be very slow."<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> With the appointment of Francis Luepp as Commissioner of Indian Affairs in 1905, Roosevelt would find the clearest expression of his ideas. Under Luepp's leadership the BIA radically altered its policy towards assimilation. Reservations expanded their vocational training on reservations, closing down boarding schools in the process.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> Leupp also scaled back the program of placing Native Americans in white public schools.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The trajectory of progressive reform among assimilationist progressives stands in contrast to the autonomous progressives such as William F. Cody. The end result remained the same: the preparation of Native peoples for adaption to modern society. But whereas assimilationist progressives cultivated the forced adoption of American ideals, autonomous progressives felt Indians needed to come to terms with modernity at their own pace. Transformation was inevitable to progressive thought, but the method of that reform would follow distinctly different paths. Between Henry Dawes and John Collier, Cody represented an early phase of accomodation during the Gilded Age. Not quite a cultural pluralist, Cody nevertheless saw much worth sustaining and celebrating in Native culture.</p>

      <p>The phrase "show Indians" likely originated among newspaper reporters and editorial writers as early as 1891. By 1893 the term appears frequently in BIA correspondence. Bureau personnel refer to Indians employed by touring shows as "show Indian," thereby indicating a form of professional status. Indians with Buffalo Bill's Wild West used the Lakota phrase "oskate wicasa," or "one who performs," to describe themselves. See L. G.
