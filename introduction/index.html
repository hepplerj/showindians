<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In early 2010 I was hired by the <a href="">Buffalo Bill Historical Center</a> to serve as a Digital Research Editor for the <a href="">Papers of William F. Cody</a>. My task was to conduct original primary source research and create a born-digital piece of historical scholarship. What resulted from that work was <a href="https://segonku.unl.edu/~jheppler/showindian/">William F. Cody and the Progressive Image of American Indians</a>, which brought together my research in conversation with secondary work on Show Indians in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. </p>

<p>The New Western Historians sought to issue correctives to what they perceived as a distorted history of the American West, a story originally emphasizing triumph, expansion, and growth.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> But in their zeal to offer correctives, they overlooked those that were very much a part of the history of the region. The New Western Historians “ignored a wide range of other significant subjects,” according to historian Gerald Nash, “whether in the realm of technological, cultural, intellectual, and economic influences.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To focus only on the roles that Indians fulfilled as attackers of whites in the Wild West – “A Prairie Emigrant Train Crossing the Plains,” “Capture of the Deadwood Mail Coach by the Indians,” and “The Battle of Little Big Horn, Showing with Historical Accuracy the Scene of Custer’s Last Charge” as some of the Wild West programs read – is to miss the other side of Buffalo Bill.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Cody indeed did portray Indians as instigators of violence, but the Wild West also exhibited Indian livelihoods, albeit a distorted one. Nor does it seem that Cody held personal hostilities towards Native Americans. Specifically, Cody’s attitudes towards Native peoples tells us much about American political life towards the turn of the century and the multifaceted visions of progressivism.</p>

<p>“Progressive” defined here means something more than the Progressive Movement of the Gilded Age. Rather, “progressivism” is loosely defined as a set of attitudes, ideas, and beliefs shared by a wide swath of political thinkers, advocates, and activists. General attitudes of reform – including religious, personal, and political – found among progressive reformers included concerns over the personal welfare and morality of American Indians as well as a nostalgia about a romanticized version of the American past. In the context of Native American reform efforts, I aver progressives were split into two camps: assimilationists and autonomous. Both camps held firmly to their convictions that social classes could be transformed and they were the bearers of those transformations, but their primary distinctions lie in the paths towards reform they laid out.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Progressive thought emerged as a primary political ideal in the late nineteenth century, and these ideas found their way into federal Indian policies.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> Between the enactment of the Dawes Act in 1887 and the Indian New Deal in 1933, progressivism continued to pursue reformist impulses to help Indians adapt to the modern world or risk perishing under the weight of progress. Henry Dawes and John Collier acted from the same font of progressive ideals, yet their two policies were markedly different from one another. Both sought to encourage changes in Indian lifestyles, but both plans differed in their pace and terms of that change. The battle between these two schools of progressive thought, what I label here “assimiliationist progressives” and “autonomous progressives,” would serve to guide U.S. Indian poicy for the next half century after the Dawes Act.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>In the personality and persona of William F. “Buffalo Bill” Cody, we can re-imagine Progressive thought at the turn of the century. More than just a battle over whose image would prevail, the public conflicts between the Wild West and the Office of Indian Affairs contested whose ideology would prevail. The battle over images went deeper into ideological battles over the definition and trajectory of progressivism and Indian reform.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> What makes the battle over whose image would prevail is motivated by whose progressivism would determine the course of reform.</p>

<p><em>William F. Cody and the Progressive Wild West</em> seeks to allow an exploration of historical data using the analytical features provided in the project. In some ways the project confirms arguments set forth by scholars such as Richard White, L.G. Moses, and Louis Warren, and in other ways provides counterexamples to their interpretations. </p>
