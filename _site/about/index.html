	<h2>About</h2>

<p>The project began as an electronic research archive of over one hundred documents and hundreds of contracts relating to Native Americans in Buffalo Bill's Wild West. The project has since evolved into a different form, allowing for the browsing and querying of documentary material and computational methods of analysis. My initial research interest drew me to the Native performers themselves, which allowed me to create -- to the best of my knowledge -- the first aggregated collection of Native American performers who were verified to work for the Wild West through primary sources such as signed contracts, government records, programs, and pamphlets. These documents are available now at the <a href="http://codyarchive.org">William F. Cody Archive</a>.</p>

<p>The project now seeks a different answer to a different question: why was the employment of Native people in Wild West shows so heavily contested? William F. Cody engaged in several highly publicized debates with government officials who sought to restrict the hiring of Native Americans during the course of the Wild West's existence.  These debates reflected a broad discussion about federal Indian policy and efforts by the government to "civilize" Native peoples. Cody, for his part, likewise believed in reform that would "save" Native peoples from what he and others saw as their inevitable demise in modern society. But Cody's form of progressivism reflected a different course of action: rather than forced coercion, a demonstration of the benefits of modern American society would usher in changes that would "save" Indians. The contest over these two ideas of progressive reform are barely distinguishable, but reveal competing ideas about federal policy, the role of government, and moral reform.</p>
