Buffalo Bill's Sioux Chieftains Show the Influences of Travel.

From the New York Times.

The last complement of Indians for Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which opens in the Madison Square Garden next week, passed through town yesterday on their way to Bridgeport, Conn., where the outfit is assembling. There were a hundred Sioux warriors fifteen squaws, and as many pappooses. They came from the Pine Ridge and Rosebud agencies, in South Dakota, where they had been chosen by Scout Bill McCune.

You see, my English is without fault, my French is better, but I've forgotten my Indian."

"I quite agree with you," said Standing Bill, another of the four, so named because he sympathetically forgives the European fad of letting bills stand, "but each time I return to my native land I see anew the errors of our boasted American civilization. We are too commercial over here. We give up too much of our minds toward the seeking of mineral things. Art we leave to Europe. All things are on a commercial basis.
