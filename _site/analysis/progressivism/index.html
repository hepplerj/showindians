	<h2> Progressivism</h2>

<p>Although certainly a political progressive in his ideas, Cody differed remarkably from government and religious progressives. Indeed, the very image of Indians he projected through the Wild West illustrates a remarkable and consistent level of sympathy. Indians themselves maintained favorable respect and admiration for Cody. Lakota scholar Vine Deloria Jr concluded that “Buffalo Bill’s relationship with the Indians, absent the aura of show business, seems above average in the positive human qualities of justice and fair play.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The intent here is not to seek definitively where Cody gets these attitudes nor to elevate Cody as a paragon of human decency, but rather how these attitudes translated into a platform of progressive thought manifest in various aspects of the Wild West.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Cody’s progressive ideals believed in encouraging Indians to become “self–sustaining,” and thus reflected the platform of reform progressives. In an editorial published in the <em>Washington Post</em> in 1888, Cody argued that Indians could improve through government assistance, necessary because they “are very like children, they need looking after” but certainly “in a very few years the Indian would be self–sustaining and a good citizen.” Fair treatment for Native Americans not only made good business sense to Cody, but would also erase problems of warfare and, thus, serve to benefit the nation’s expansionist agenda. To prevent warfare, Cody advocated enlisting Indians as regular soldiers in the U.S. army. If an Indian “enlisted as a soldier and employed in guarding our frontier,” Cody wrote, “he cannot at the same time be stealing horses or carrying on a depredatory war.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Cody established this line of reasoning early in his showman career. During the 1878-1879 theatrical season, he hired a group of Pawnee but encountered criticism from government officials. According to Cody, he informed the Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz that he thought he was “benefitting the Indians as well as the government, by taking them all over the United States, and giving them a correct idea of the customs, life, etc., of the pale faces, so that when they returned to their people they could make known all they had seen.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> Schurz allowed Cody to hire them as long as he could assure them safe return to their homes at the end of the season. Cody’s early encounter with the federal bureaucracy set a precedent of formalizing contracts with Native employees and a familiar justification for hiring Indians once he organized the Wild West.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>What of the Progressive argument that traditional Indian culture was debauched, backwards, and uncivilized? It would seem under these circumstances that Cody could not be considered a Progressive. Cody was not just fascinated by romantic notions of tribalism, but displayed a consistent sympathy to Indian culture. “We must not forget,” he wrote, “that we owe the Indians something.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> But his ideas regarding Native peoples reveals the split between assimilationist progressives and autonomous progressives. He believed in self-improvement and change for Native peoples – little different from the same reformist impulses that guided religious and government reformers. The difference between the two progressive camps lay not in the end result, but rather in the method of progressivism’s implementation.</p>

<p>The forced adoption of Euro-American values was never Cody’s intention with his traveling combination. While he believed that Indians needed to adopt certain aspects of American culture to ensure their survival, Cody’s advocacy of reform emphasized the role that Indians themselves would play in transforming their lifestyles rather than forced government or religious programs–<em>gradual</em> change rather than <em>enforced</em>. In Cody’s mind, travel off the reservations, viewing the sights of modernity, and exposure to Western culture would do more to impress upon Indians the superiority of Western culture over their own. He consistently maintained that travel, in the words of one newspaper report, helped Indians “adopt the manners and customs of the white men [better] than does life on the reservation” and Indians “are benefited rather than injured” by traveling with the Wild West.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Indeed, much of the conflict between whites and Native peoples, according to Cody, stemmed from the policies of the federal government. “In nine times out of ten,” he said once, “where there is trouble between white men and Indians, it will be found that the white man is responsible.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> Conflict, for Cody, was consistently a result of white aggression. Talking to a newspaper reporter in 1879, he explained that “there are a number of men who make it a profession to steal horses from the Indians. . . . In fact, there is a regular market for them. Although I have had many a tough fight with the red man my sympathy is with him entirely, because he has been ill-used and trampled on by those whose duty it was to protect him.”<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Nor did Cody find a need to eradicate aspects of Native culture, contrary to the policies of the government. Cody never discourage religious activity in Indian camps that were set up with the exhibition or promote English-only language.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> In this sense Cody was unlike other Anglo-Americans. By temperament and attitude he saw the diversity of language not as a problem but rather as a necessity and a key feature of the American West. While intolerant Indian school officials forbade the use of Native languages and other segments of the population promoted English as a national language, Cody was partaking in the diversity of western language. For example, Cody writes in his autobiography that he learned much from Kickapoo Indians in Kansas, including their sports, how to shoot a bow and arrow, and learned to talk their language.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Certainly Cody’s decision to allow Indians to “be Indian” was part of his showmanship – an Indian camp behind the scenes that contained all the vestiges of an exotic lifestyle rather than Euro-American life was more attractive to customers. But even when the curious eyes of onlookers departed at the day’s end, Cody never enforced strict assimilationist ideals to discourage tribal culture. At other times he seemed more comfortable among Native Americans under his employ. George Dull Knife recalled Cody leaving his hotel to sleep in the Indian camps, checking to ensure they had enough to eat, took them on sight-seeing tours, and gave them parting gifts at the end of the season.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup> Enabling Native peoples to come to terms with modernity, for Cody, would be more beneficial than the forced restructuring of their culture sought by Reformist Progressives.</p>

<p>Cody’s West was still a Mythic West. The Wild West did not reflect the diversity of Native cultures that comprised the region, but instead portrayed all Indians as stereotypically Lakota. After all, the bedrock of Cody’s West consisted of locale and collective memory: the locale of Cody’s West was primarily the lands west of the Rocky Mountains and the collective memory played into popular understandings of cowboys, Indians, homesteads, and westering. The image of Indians in the Wild West reveals further cleavages in thought between assimilationist and autonomous progressives. Assimilationists cared deeply about the physical welfare of Indians employed with the Wild West, but also channeled much of their energy into the image of Native Americans that would be consumed by the public. The resistance of employment among government officials, religious reformers, and others reflected a belief that show businesses were immoral and counterproductive to the mission of reform. The Wild West emphasized difference – Indian dances, warfare, equestrianism, culture – rather than the elements that made Indians white. The Wild West, in the eyes of reformers, depicted the spectacles of savagery rather than the superiority of civilization.</p>

<p>Cody’s West simultaneously celebrated regional diversity while promoting homogenized visions of western Native Americans. The image affixed in the popular mind was a version of Lakota. Publicity posters, for example, depicted Indians dressed in feathered headdresses, buckskins, mounted on horseback, and living in tipis. Frequently publicity material depicted Indians as exotic and rarely viewed them as individuals. Yet Cody highlighted elements of his western fiction that were uniquely American. Wild West promotional material frequently pointed to the nationality of performers — cossacks, Mexicans, Arabs, Germans. Strikingly, a version of the publicity poster for the Wild West was an American Indian on horseback looking to the distance wearing buckskins, feathers, and carrying a rifle. The poster is titled “An American.” Cody’s West presented Indians as uniquely and American.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>Newspaper accounts likewise emphasized the “civilizing” influence the Show had on Indian employees. “If there is any one who cherishes an idea that a Wild West Indian is not a gallant and chivalrous gentleman,” noted a New York Times reporter, “should have been at the Wild West Show last Wednesday night. To have seen Iron Tail . . . his face wreathed with smiles, waving the long feathered pole . . . and to have seen Joe Black Fox’s shining countenance beaming above a big bunch of spangled violets would dispel all doubts.”<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup> For Cody, the Wild West was a space for Indians to become educated of the modern world but also protected against its worst aspects.</p>

      <p>The only exception was the Ghost Dance. Cody explained that “I prohibit the ‘ghost dance’ in my camp, as it stirs up fanaticism.” If the Wild West was going to help reform Indians, having them perform the Ghost Dance – either in the camp or in the arena for exhibition – would be contrary to those objectives.
