	<h2>Wild West as Advocate</h2>

<p>Travel, wage earning, and cultural participation undercut the missionary and reform ideology underlying progressive reform. A frequent and outspoken critic of Buffalo Bill’s Wild West and the image he portrayed of Native Americans was the federal government. Reformist Progressives, convinced that Native Americans would perish without their assistance, recoiled at the thought of Indians being allowed to continue cultural practices with the Wild West while simultaneously such practices were being suppressed on reservations.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Cody, as an autonomous progressive, strenuously defended his case for using Native Americans in the Wild West. To be successful, Cody and the Show Indians needed to convince detractors that they were not just reenacting histories of the Old West; they were, through performance, passing from savagery to civilization. Reformist Progressives needed to be convinced that Indians were coming closer and closer to being middle-class whites like their audience.</p>

<p>For Lakota themselves, they were driven to perform as much for money as for the work itself. Employment on the reservation was poorly paid and scarce, while riding horse and performing dances in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West offered a sustenance of culture and substantial wages. Standard wages for male Indians in the Wild West was $25 per month, while translators and other performers considered more prestigious could earn salaries as high as $125. Women were usually paid direct salaries of $10 per month and children offered a chance to increase wages by an additional $5. Nuclear families (often favored by Cody in order to retain moral in Indian camps) had the potential to make $50 per month with the Wild West. In addition to being well paid, contracts signed with Indian performers ensured they would be fed well, clothed, and receive gifts at the end of the season.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The Wild West went to great lengths to demonstrate to its audiences and critics that the exhibition benefited Indians. Cody, John Burke, Nate Salsbury, and other publicists frequently pointed to the benefits of travel introducing Indians to the apex of civilization while also shielding them from its shady underside. One reviewer wrote in 1885 that “among changes of [Indian] habit and ideas which have been effected” were “the adoption of Christian and civilized attire and even manners, and some progress in the acquisition and use of our language.” Yet “it was quite noticeable that they had escaped, as aboriginal visitors rarely do, the corruption of some of the vicious and demoralizing habits of our civilization.”<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> Later newspaper articles attempted to demonstrate the same beneficial aspects of the Wild West. A writer in the Washington Post in 1907 applauded Indians becoming “citizens of the world,” and quoted with approval Young Man Not Afraid of a Thirst, who spoke of Europe as “the highest ideal of civilization finds its individual embodiment in that man who speaks each language as though he were a native. You see, my English is without fault, my French is better, but I’ve forgotten my Indian.”<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> The Wild West was not a path of debauchery, but the avenue for Americanism and cosmopolitanism.</p>

<p>This view, however, was hotly and publicly contested. Any misstep by Cody that could raise the charge of debauchery could undo all the energy the Wild West poured into combating its critics. The federal government took early steps to ensure Indians were treated with respect. In the winter of 1886, the Indian Bureau began regulating the employment of Show Indians. Those hired by any Wild West exhibition or circus were required to sign individual contracts, provide their Indian employees with adequate food, shelter, and medical care, pay salaries, hire chaplains and interpreters, and return Show Indians to their homes at the close of the season. If an exhibition violated a contract, they risked forfeiting their bonds and could lose the ability to hire Indians at all. Although no Wild West show ever violated their contract, several assimilationists attempted to gather enough evidence to prove allegations of mistreatment and exploitation that could lead the government to ban Indian employment with exhibitions.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The challenges started early. Rumors of drunkenness and immorality in the Wild West reached government investigators in 1886. Cody’s publicist, John Burke, reassured government authorities that no such activity was tolerated; indeed, their contracts stipulated that Indians “agree[d] to keep sober and obey the rules and regulations” of the Wild West or would be “returned to Agency, forfeiting salary due him.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> Additional challenges arose in 1887 when New York Congressman Darwin Rush James called for an investigation of Wild West entertainment and asked the Secretary of the Interior to justify Indians “presenting before the public scenes representing their lowest savage characteristics, and . . . to what extent the exhibitions are under the auspices of the Government of the United States.”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> In language that reflected Cody’s personal attitude as well as the official position of the company, Cody responded with a letter to Congressman James explaining that “these Indians, as Americans, have a perfect right to hire their services where they please” and asserted that “all their associations here are elevating morally.”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> No government investigation came out of James’s condemnation and Cody retained his bond and permission to use Indians in the Wild West.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> But as James illustrates, Cody’s critics came from all corners of government.</p>

<p>Government authorities quickly turned their scrutiny to the Wild West. Letting Indians perform in the Wild West, wrote one agent, did not “encourage the Indians in legitimate or honorable habits of industry.”<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> The acting Pine Ridge agent warned that by performing in the Wild West “the Indian is thus taught that savagery has a market value and is worth retaining.” The Wild West “seriously retards progress,” exposes Indians to a “fetid and impure” moral atmosphere, and permits and encourages that “which ordinarily would be suppressed by the police.” Furthermore, the agent warned, the “shows are not instructive or beneficial to the whites, conveying as they do wrong ideas and impressions regarding the Indians.”<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> The Wild West, in the minds of government officials, provided no benefits for anyone.</p>

<p>Cody attempted to fend off government complaints with stipulations included in contracts. To most assimilationist progressives the Wild West would only lead to wickedness by enticing its employees with the shady underside of civilization. The Wild West offered assurances that employees under their hire would be barricaded from such influences. The language of the contracts can be read as a progressive text. For example, the text of one of Cody’s contracts stipulated that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Buffalo Bill’s Wild West would] protect the said party from all immoral influences and surroundings, and provide all needful medical attendance and medicine and do all such other acts and things as may be requisite and proper for the health, comfort and welfare of the said party of the second part and return him to the said Agency at the expiration of this agreement, without cost to the party of the second part or to the Government of U.S. The party of the second part agrees to keep sober and obey the rules and regulations governing the establishment of the party of the first part, failing to do so he will be returned to the Agency FORFEITING ALL SALARY DUE HIM.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consistent emphasis on immorality, welfare, sobriety, and health in the contracts over time point not only to an effort to deflect criticism but incorporated the rhetoric of progressive ideas. John M. Burke explained to a newspaper reporter, stereotypically citing a “common conception . . . that the Indian is a great consumer of whiskey,” that contracts stipulated Indians “refrain from all drinking, gambling, and fighting.” They enforced the agreement by appointing “an Indian policeman” who is “paid $10 more a month than the rank and file” and is “responsible for the conduct of those under him.” Burke further explained they teach “them that a saloon is a very bad place for an Indian.” To reinforce the Wild West’s common attitude of the exhibition as an advocate for Indian reform, Burke concluded that travel “had an educating influence upon them” and would be brought back and shared upon their return home.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>In 1890, a particularly bad bout of injuries and illnesses led to a government investigation into Buffalo Bill’s Wild West. During a tour of Europe, four Lakotas died in various accidents. Later when five Indians left the Wild West before the close of the season en route for Pine Ridge, Kills Plenty became ill and died in a New York hospital. Kills Plenty’s comrades – Eagle Horn, White Horse, Bear Pipe, and Kills White Weasel – on their way through immigration control came across retired General James O’Beirne, the assistant superintendent of immigration. According to O’Beirne, the Indians complained of poor treatment at the hands of Cody and his managers. He took their complaints to government authorities and the press.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>O’Beirne’s allegations would spark the first of a series government investigations into the Wild West. By the time the 1890 season closed, Reformists charges of mistreatment were appearing in headlines in major dailies. For a time, Reformist critiques appeared to be confirmed, and Cody and Nate Salsbury, for the first time in their careers, faced the very real prospect of being denied Show Indians to hire. Cody attempted to salvage the wave of criticism by sending Burke to contest the allegations, but even sympathizers in the government had to support the investigations. No Neck, Black Heart, and others testified before an official Office of Indian Affairs inquiry. “You are engaged in the exhibition or show businesses,” noted A. C. Belt, the Acting Commissioner of Indian Affairs. “It is not considered among white people to be a very helpful or elevating business. I believe that that which is not good for the white people is not good for the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians.”<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup> Thirty-six Indians were brought before the inquiry into Cody’s treatment. The inquiry ruled in Cody’s favor, concluding he had carried out their contracts, were paid regularly, and given plenty of food. One of the Show Indians admonished O’Beirne as someone who should “not be listened to.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>Challenges to Cody’s hiring of Show Indians came from the Indian Service itself as well. In 1887 Indian Commissioner John D. C. Atkins informed his agents that Indians were strictly prohibited from appearing in Wild West exhibitions without explicit permission from the Indian Service. Atkins, in language familiar to Reformist Progressives, complained about “irresponsible persons” that took Indians away from reservations and, thus, the activities he deemed appropriate for assimilation.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup> Such an attitude would continue in the Indian Service through the remainder of the nineteenth century. Commissioner John H. Oberly, well-respected among Reformist Progressives, explained his opposition to the Wild West:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The effect of traveling all over the country among, and associated with, the class of people usually accompanying Shows, Circuses and Exhibitions, attended by all the immoral and unchristianizing surroundings incident to such a life, is not only most demoralizing to the present and future welfare of the Indian, but it creates a roaming and unsettled disposition and educates him in a manner entirely foreign and antagonistic to that which has been and now is the policy of the Government.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The future of the Indian’s welfare, in Oberly’s mind, lay with them improving their homesteads on reservations rather than touring with the Wild West.
In the summer of 1889, a new Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Thomas Jefferson Morgan, arrived for his duties. A Baptist minister and educator, Morgan would begin strenuosity challenging Cody and Salsbury in their employment of Show Indians. Morgan was not content with simply the physical and moral welfare of Show Indians; he fully planned to use the powers of his office to end the practice altogether. Although he could not officially deny contracts, he acted as though he could. He began demanding expectations that the Wild West was unable or unwilling to meet, and thus had the ability to turn down contracts that crossed his desk. “When the lowest type of Indian, with his war dances, paint and blanket is exhibited,” he explained to a reporter, “the public mind accepts him as typical of the Indians of today. This . . . is misleading.”<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup> Morgan also warned Wild West exhibitions that they could face the loss of their bonds if they failed to strictly uphold their agreement with the government. </p>

<p>Not only did exhibitions face Morgan’s wrath, but so did would-be Show Indians. Morgan threatened Show Indians with the loss of allotments, annuities, and tribal status. In his first annual report to the Secretary of the Interior, Morgan wrote that “Indians must conform to ‘the white man’s ways,’ peaceably if they will, forcibly if they must.” He concluded that “this civilization may not be the best possible, but it is the best the Indians can get. They cannot escape it, and must either conform to it or be crushed by it.”<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup> The only way to become acceptable in Morgan’s eyes was to quit the Show Indian business entirely.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Between 1893 and 1903, two commissioners would head the Indian Service. Although these years are the most extensive for Show Indian employment, according to L. G. Moses, there is little information available about them in either press accounts or official correspondence.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup> Morgan’s hatred of Show Indian employment would continue unabated, but the Reformist Progressives would lose their ally in 1893 when Morgan resigned and was replaced with Judge Daniel M. Browning of Illinois. Whereas Morgan sought to challenge Show Indian employment to the point that he supported legislation banning all forms of Indian employment, Browning showed no signs of opposition. But Browning’s successor, William A. Jones, would again place the assimilationist agenda back into Indian policy. His hostility towards the Wild West Show almost equaled Morgan’s and led him, in 1899, to ban government participation in contracting Indians for employment. The Office of Indian Affairs refused to oversee the signing of contracts and largely retreated entirely from the regulation of Indian employment.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup> The Bureau, in essence, cut off all ties with the Wild West exhibitions until Francis Leupp, Jones’ successor, resumed the practice of overseeing contracts.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" rel="footnote">24</a></sup></p>

<p>Indians would continue to find employment with the Wild West despite frequent challenges from the government. The contrasting images of Indians envisioned by assimilationist progressives and autonomous progressives would define the Show Indian experience throughout the entirely of the Wild West. But by 1904, when the Wild West participated in the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Cody and the Show Indians had gained the upper hand in defending their employment practices.</p>

      <p>The employment of Indians with the Wild West would not be without its Indian critics as well. Chauncey Yellow Robe, for example, protested the “evil and degrading influence of commercializing the Indian before the world” through their employment with the Wild West. Yellow Robe specifically denounced the encouragement of native traditions, remarking that the “white man is persistently perpetuating the tribal habits and customs.” Yellow Robe, “The Menace of the Wild West Show,” <em>Quarterly Journal of the Society of American Indians</em> (July-Sept., 1914): 224-225. In 1901 the Oglala Tribal Council petitioned the federal government to “grant no more permits or contracts to any white man to take out any Indians for exhibition purposes.” Quoted in Warren, <em>Buffalo Bill’s America</em>, 373. See “Petition from the Tribal Council,” May 10, 1901, “Petitions, ca. 1975-1907,” Box 780, RG 75, Pine Ridge, NARA-CPR.<a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

Warren (p. 366) notes that show managers calculated they paid $74,300 in wages to Pine Ridge Indians between 1885 and 1891 and this amount increased quickly over time. Where Sioux employees would make $11,500 in the 1886-87 season, by 1889 they could expect to make $28,800. The Wild West was not only a preferred reservation employer because it offered a chance to leave the reservation and participate in cultural activities, but it also proved quite lucrative.
