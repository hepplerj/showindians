	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Buffalo Bill’s Wild West reflected progressive themes and concepts. Through theatrical depictions of Native Americans in publicity material, performances, and the Indian camp outside the arena, to the personal attitudes and beliefs of William F. Cody, Cody envisioned the Wild West envisioned as beneficial to social reform and harmony through its employment of Native peoples. Cody embodied the “westward-moving, industrially modern American” and maintained devotion to Native friends, the middle-class, and rural virtues.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> The modern elements of life coming to the West — evident in Cody’s own attempts at canal construction, town building, mining, and ranching — pointed to a bright future. The future of the West became the embodiment of America’s future.</p>

<p>The disorienting tumult of travel, cities, crowds, and the unfamiliar led some, like American Horse, to wish to “cover my head with a blanket, so that I can see no more and have a chance to think over what I have seen.”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Yet, as American Horse did for many years, several hundred Native Americans found employment with the Wild West. Lakota people remember Cody as a fair employer and signed up with the Wild West for their own social, cultural, and economic reasons. Samuel Lone Bear, Sitting Bull, No Neck, Standing Bear, Iron Tail, and many others gravitated to Cody eagerly and in large numbers. Although the Wild West’s overall depiction of Indians was culturally oppressive – indeed, Cody’s ideology of reform left little room for the sustenance of Native culture – performance brought a sense of liberation and a form of resistance to assimilationists. </p>

<p>Modernity would not exempt Native Americans, and the Wild West was a method for Cody to help introduce what he considered the apex of civilization to them. Traveling with the Wild West served the progressive purpose of reform. Enacting cultural practices would not entrench Native culture, in Cody’s mind, but rather employment in a lucrative business would provide Native peoples with a new set of ideas and attitudes that would become widespread as the West developed under the march of progress. </p>
