# Letter from Cody to Liddiard

Glasgow

Aug 5th/04

My Dear Bill,

I will let you know about bringing Indians soon as I can hear from my agents in Parisâ€”in two or three weeks. We are after a great Building there.

My business is simply great. We will get pretty near to $70.000 here this week.

Your friend

Bill Cody
