## Letter from William F. Cody to John R. Brennan

Glen Falls N. Y. June 18th 1909

Dear Col Brennan,

Pardon me for forgetting to send the $1.00 for the telegram.

We are getting along nicely. <span title="NA:Members" style="background-color: transparent; ">These Brules haven't the snap and get up that the Ogalallas have but they do fairly well. And they work for [...] half the wages. We paid the Ogalallas [...] amounts to a big lot of money on the seasons.

Please remember me to Iron Tail or any of my red brothers</span>.

With my very kindest regards to your self,

[...] yours truly,

W. F. Cody
