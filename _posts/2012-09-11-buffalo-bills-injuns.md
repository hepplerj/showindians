# Buffalo Bill's Injuns

About twenty Indians from Pine Ridge agency in charge of Major Burke, Buffalo Bill's lieutenant, arrived here this morning. They were joined by an equal number of ex-hostiles from Fort Sheridan, and the aggregation later left for New York en route for Europe to join the Wild West show.
