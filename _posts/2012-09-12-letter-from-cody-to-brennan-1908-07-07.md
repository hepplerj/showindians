## Letter from William F. Cody to John R. Brennan

Worcester, Mass. July 7th/08

Major John R. Brennan

Pine Ridge Agency

My Dear Major—

I am {% c NA:Members%}sending six Indians home to day. Not but what they are good men{% ec %}. but four of them are not fit for duty, and two of them claim their families are sick. These men all wanted to go home so I let them go— I hope it will be satisfactory to you—

Very truly yours

W. F. Cody
