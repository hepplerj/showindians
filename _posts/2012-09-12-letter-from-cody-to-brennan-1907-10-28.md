# Letter from William F. Cody to John R. Brennan

Major John R. Brennan.

Agent Pine Ridge Agency

So. Dak.

My Dear Major,

The Indians with me want a favor. And as they have been such good men I hope you will grant it.

{% c NA:Character%}They have been saving and bought a great many useful things to take home. But they are shy a [unclear] and it breaks an Indians heart to go home without a trunk{% ec %}.

They would like to have {% c BBWW:Business%}$10 each the $25 a month men. The Chiefs $15 each{% ec %}. This to be taken from their last month and back pay that is to be paid them in your presence.

Hope you will grant their request.

Very faithfully yours

W. F. Cody
