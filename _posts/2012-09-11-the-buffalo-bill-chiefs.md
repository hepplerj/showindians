<h2>THE BUFFALO BILL CHIEFS.</h2>

<h3>They Think It Folly to Fight Against the Pale Faces.</h3>

A Bee special from Pilger, Neb., says: {%c NA:Members%}Two special coaches from Washington, containing forty-five of Buffalo Bill's Indians, passed through here to-day en route to Pine Ridge agency{%ec%}. All have friends and relatives there. {%c NA:Members%}Rocky Bear, Black Heart, Little Wolf, Black Elk{%ec%} and other prominent chiefs are among them. {%c Progressivism:IndianProblem%}Several of the party had received letters from Pine Ridge, {%c Context:IndianWars%}speaking of the Messiah{%ec%}, {%c BBWW:Travel%}before they sailed from Europe{%ec%}{%ec%}.

{%c Progressivism:IndianProblem%}Through an interpreter Rock Bear said he thought his party could do more than any others to quiet their brothers at Pine Ridge. "My people," he said, "may get crazed, as white people do, over religion. If so, I am sorry. We here know that the day for the red man to fight against the pale face is long past."{%ec%}
