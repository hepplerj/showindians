# The Indian Actors

## An Attempt by the Interior Department to take them from Buffalo Bill.

{% c Progressivism:IndianWelfare%}The commissioner of Indian affairs, having found that the Pawnees with the Buffalo Bill combination are off their reservation without permission, issued an order that they should return immediately{%ec%}. {% c NA:Descriptions%}When this fact became known to the Indians they executed a terrific war dance, held an excited pow-wow, and finally concluded not to go{%ec%}. Mr. Cody then took the matter in hand, and called upon the commissioner, stating that {% c BBWW:Business%}if the order was carried into effect, it would cause considerable pecuniary loss to him, as the combination had been advertised for appearance for twenty days ahead{%ec %}. {% c NA:Treatment%}He also assured the commissioner that the Indians were well treated{%ec%}. {% c Progressivism:IndianWelfare%}The commissioner then revoked his order, on condition that Mr. Cody enter into $5,000 bonds to return the Indians after a specified time (within which it is agreed the Indians shall be kept sober) to their agency at his own expense{%ec%}. This arrangement was satisfactory, and Mr. Cody departed happy. The dusky chiefs of the forest sang "O-be-joyful!" and will {% c NA:Descriptions%}{% c Image:Savagery%}indulge in deeds of daring and blood-curdling horror upon the stage, instead of living on Government rations at their agency{%ec%}{%ec%}.
