Capt Charles Penney

Dear Captain.

I presume you were informed by the Interior Dept.[^1] that I have permission for Indians. I am writing Shangrau.[^2] And I don't wish to commence looking up Indians. Until I have your permission so if you see Shangrau will you please speak to him about it. I will not want the Indians much before May. but its well to be letting them know. I will try my best to come after them my selfâ€”

With my best wishes

Yours truly

W. F. Cody
