## Letter from Iron Tail to John R. Brennan

Exmouth, England.

May 27th, I904

Major J. R. Brenan,

Dear Sir:-

<span title="NA:Treatment" style="background-color: transparent; ">I will now write few lines to let you know we are getting along very nice with the Show. Good food and clothing and every thing</span>. Major, <span title="Progressivism:Reform" style="background-color: transparent; ">I want you to hold my boy's, Philip Iron Tail, money, until I come again. I think I got right to save some for the Little Ones. Don't you see they would spent in a day or two, of course we Indians don't know how to handle money, so if you give the widow all at once, her parents get hold of it and spent on their self, so I like you to be Gardian of the money</span>. 

Hold the money until I come again, then we can see what we will do it. Now will close this time. <span title="NA:Treatment" style="background-color: transparent; ">We are all fat and healthy because we are under good care</span>. Answer soon.

Glad to shake hands with you.

Chief Iron Tail 

Per M. B.
