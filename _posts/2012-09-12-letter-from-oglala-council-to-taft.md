## Letter from Oglala Tribal Council to William H. Taft

Manderson, S.D.  
Dec. 23, 1911

Wm H. Taft, President, U. S.  
Washington, D. C. 

My dear Friend,

We would like tell you some thing and this is the thing.

<span title="NA:Treatment" style="background-color: transparent; ">One of the Big chiefs of the Oglala Sioux (Good Lance's) son died at Garden City, Kan, Buffalo Bill's show left him there sick at hospital and died there</span>, and our Indian Agent, Mr. Brennan, said "I don't want this show, but you Indians wanted and cause some boys sickness" and he said let the Oglala Council talk about this (boy died) body. So the Council had meeting about it. And they wanted this (boy's) dead body to be send over here and they wrote a letter to Buffalo Bill's show.

<span title="BBWW:Immoral" style="background-color: transparent; ">Mr. Brennan, the agent signed his name on the letter and they gave it to the Buffalo Bills show, but he didn't do as what the Oglala council said, and that's the reason why the council wrote to you, and they don't want Buffal Bills show to get contract from you, and we don't want them to come to Pine Ridge Reservation after show boys again</span>.

<span title="Progressivism:Reform" style="background-color: transparent; ">We don't want any boys to go of show again. We don't want them as they got allotment and they got to work on their allotment</span>. <span title="BBWW:Immoral" style="background-color: transparent; ">But the Buffalo Bill's show bother them all the time, and we don't want no other show to come over here after show boys again. There are several boys died on account of show, they had small wages, and they don't do them any good</span>.

<span title="BBWW:Immoral" style="background-color: transparent; ">We don't want the (Buffalo Bills) and other shows to get contract from you again</span>

We want that dead body to be send back over here (at Pine Ridge)

So we want (Buffalo Bills) him to do as what the Oglala council wanted, this is all to tell you

We are
