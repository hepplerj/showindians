Capt Geo LeRoy Brown,United States Indian ServicePine Ridge Agency, S.D.

My dear Captain,Your favor of August 9th to hand, which found us all well here. We are all going home in October, and the Indians will reach Pine Ridge Agency about the 1st of November. I lately sent two Indians home who were not sick, but who complained a
 little of lung complaint. I sent them home as I had plenty here without them.

I have informed the Indians who have been sending money to write & explain to you who the money was intended for. As they are going home so soon I hardly think they will send any more money to their relatives.

Thanking you for past favors,I am,Very truly yours,W. F. Cody1Note 1: This signature appears to be in William F. Cody's hand, but the rest of the letter is not.  Cody apparently signed a letter that had been drafted by someone else.
