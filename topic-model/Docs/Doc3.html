Dear Major,

I am sending two Indians home who have lung trouble. And the only care for return is dry air which they can't have here. Sitting Bull Jr. and Jonas Spider the rest are all well and happy. I will take good care of them. I enclose my route. Will be glad to hear how you settled with the Rail Road. In regard to those who were killed and injured

Very truly yours
W. F. Cody
