William McCune, With the Buffalo Bill Show, Tells How They Are Controlled.

The speaker was William McCune.  He is the general Western agent for Buffalo Bill's Wild West show.  Mr. McCune is spending a few days in Kansas City at the home of his sister, Mrs. J. S. Scott, who lives at 2409 Indiana avenue.

In the early spring he goes to the Pine Ridge Indian agency in South Dakota.  There he selects 100 Sioux warriors, squaws, and pappooses to accompany the Wild West show during the season.  In the fall or early winter Mr. McCune travels westward again, accompanying the Indians back to the reservation.  Mr. McCune speaks the Sioux tongue readily.

The Indians who get drunk or become disturbers are fined $5.  The money comes out of their pay.  If the offense is repeated they are fined $10.
